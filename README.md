# R---Prediction-Model-
WALMART SALES Prediction Model (R- tidyverse, tidymodels, skimr, plotly)

Performed data cleansing and preprocessing (tidy verse), applied Linear and Logistic Regression, developed sub-models to ensemble predictions on weekly sales, employed quadratic and logarithmic transformation on explanatory and response variables.

Interpreted statistical plots (plotly) and ANOVA output(on model comparison) to select best fit model- achieved following performance statistics - RMSE = 0.219, MAE = 0.157, Adjusted R-squared = 0.81

# .rmd file has been attached which can be run on RStudio to see the interactive visualizations and prediction outputs. Also, .csv file(preprocessed) which has been imported has been appended. 
# do not forget to set working directory before running the code chunks.
